    "- Many organizations and government policies are working to bridging the digital divide by providing computers to people who do not have access ot them or simply raising money and recycling old electronics that are not used anymore. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Technoligy has become a crucuoal part of many of our lives, and those who do not have access to it from a young age have a obvious disadvantage in getting jobs or other oppurtunities presented to them. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Summary: Limited access to digital resources can create inequalities in groups, affecting participation in the digital economy and education. Bridging this gap needs collective efforts through humanitarian initiatives. Individually, challenges arise for those with restricted web access, impacting personal development, and choices like buying devices can unintentionally contribute to the divide."
